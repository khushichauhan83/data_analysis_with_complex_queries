*Description*:- 

I performed advanced data analysis using SQL. The main objective of this project was to analyze employee-related data and extract useful trends and patterns using SQL queries. The project focused on implementing window functions, subqueries, and CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to solve complex business questions.

The data consisted of employee information such as names, salaries, departments, gender, and date of birth. I used this data to answer questions like:

Which department has the highest total and average salary?

Who are the top earners in the company?

Which employees are earning more or less than their department average?

What is the distribution of employees across departments?

Are there any salary differences based on gender?

I used functions like RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), SUM() , and AVG() to perform advanced analysis. I also implemented nested subqueries using EXISTS, NOT EXISTS, and comparison-based queries to find specific conditions. CTEs were used to break complex queries into readable parts and to reuse logic.

All SQL queries are written clearly with inline comments for better understanding. The outputs and screenshots of the queries are combined in a Word file with analysis only where necessary. Simple outputs are shown directly without extra explanation.

This project helped me improve my SQL skills and understand how to solve real-world problems using data. It also taught me how to write clean, readable, and optimized queries.
